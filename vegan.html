    <h1>Socca, a gluten-free flatbread, also known as farinata and panisse is made throughout Western Europe as well as
        other places including Argentina and Algeria. </h1>
    <p>Socca is an incredibly simple and quick flatbread to put together, which makes it an easy option for weeknight
        dinners. Conversely, it’s presentation once topped or paired with dips is elegant enough for entertaining. </p>
    <p>The flavor is slightly reminiscent of chickpeas, but it doesn’t taste like beans. It’s very mild; you might not
        even know it was made from chickpeas if no one told you. The flavor of the olive oil will be prominent here, so
        a good quality olive oil goes a long way. This is a perfect recipe to have in your repertoire for any time you
        want to whip up a homemade bread without any hassle. </p>
